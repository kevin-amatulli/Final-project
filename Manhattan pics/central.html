						<p>The Central Park Conservancy was founded in 1980 by a group of   dedicated civic and philanthropic leaders. They were determined to end   Central Park's dramatic decline in the 1970s and restore it to its   former splendor as America's first and foremost major urban public   space, as envisioned by its 19th-century designers, Frederick Law   Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. Today, the Conservancy's mission is to   restore, manage and enhance Central Park, in partnership with the   public, for the enjoyment of present and future generations.</p>
						<p>In 1998, the Conservancy and the City of New York signed a management   agreement formalizing their then 18-year public-private partnership.   The relationship was reaffirmed in 2006 when the agreement was renewed   for an additional eight years. As the official manager of Central Park,   the Conservancy is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and   operation of the Park. Presently, 90 percent of the Park's maintenance   operations staff is employed by the Conservancy, which provides 85   percent of Central Park's $45.8 million annual Parkwide expense budget   through its fundraising and investment revenue. The City, in addition to   the annual fee to the Conservancy for the services it provides, funds   lighting, maintenance of the Park drives and enforcement. </p>
