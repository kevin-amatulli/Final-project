						<p>Since its founding in 1974 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Capa" title="Cornell Capa">Cornell Capa</a> with help from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micha_Bar-Am" title="Micha Bar-Am">Micha Bar-Am</a> in the historic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Straight" title="Willard Straight">Willard Straight</a> House, on Fifth Avenue's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Mile,_New_York_City" title="Museum Mile, New York City">Museum Mile</a>,   ICP has presented over 500 exhibitions, bringing the work of more than   3,000 photographers and other artists to the public in one-person and   group exhibitions and provided thousands of classes and workshops for   tens of thousands of students. ICP was founded as an institution to keep   the legacy of 'Concerned Photography' alive. After the untimely deaths   of his brother <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Capa" title="Robert Capa">Robert Capa</a> and his colleagues <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Bischof" title="Werner Bischof">Werner Bischof</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Seymour" title="David Seymour">Chim (David Seymour)</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Weiner" title="Dan Weiner">Dan Weiner</a> in the 1950s, Capa saw the need to keep their humanitarian documentary   work in the public eye. In 1966 he founded the International Fund for   Concerned Photography. By 1974 it was obvious the Fund needed a home,   and the International Center of Photography was created.</p>
						<p>ICP has seen enormous growth in its exhibitions, collections,   education programs, and staff. In 1985, a satellite facility, ICP   Midtown, was created to help accommodate this growth. Over the years, as   ICP continued to develop, it became clear that further expansion wasnot   possible in the Fifth Avenue location, and plans were made for the   major redesign and reconstruction of the Midtown location to meet the   challenges of the flourishing museum, educational and community   programs.</p>
