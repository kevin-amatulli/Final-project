						<p> Established in 1917, Fort Tilden is named for Samuel Tilden, who served   as Governor of New York from 1875 to 1876. It was the most modern   addition to the fortifications of New York Harbor intended to defend the   city from attack by sea and air. Through four decades the fort's   defenses were upgraded with the technologically advanced weaponry of   succeeding generations, including smooth-bore cannons, sixteen inch   naval rifles, and Nike Ajax and Hercules air defense missiles. </p>
						<p> Eventually its weaponry became obsolete, and the fort was decommissioned   as a military installation in 1974.  It was then transferred to the   control of the National Park Service. </p>
