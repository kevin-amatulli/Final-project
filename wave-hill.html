          <td>Just off the Henry Hudson Parkway, Wave Hill is very close to downtown Manhattan but feels like you are in the most bucolic countryside miles from any city. We bought sandwiches and sat on the peaceful walled terrace (no view but very pretty) and then walked around and we just kept discovering new views of the Hudson and we came upon innumerous small interior tucked away gardens, Spring was in full bloom but i canc imagine that the gardens are beuatiful as they change all year round. There are Wave Hill chairs (a version of an Adirondack chair) scattered around the property and it seemed like lots of people brought their books and came to relax for an hour or so. The shop is beautiful and has a nice variety of garden things, fashion, children's things and homewares. Being a weekday we were able to park in the lot on site</td>
