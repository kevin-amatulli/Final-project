			<td>Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced on October 16, 2012 that the gravesite of Admiral David Glasgow Farragut has been designated a National Historic Landmark.  Farragut was the son of Jorge Antonio Farragut-Mesquida, a Spaniard from the island of Minorca and is universally recognized as one of the most accomplished officers in American naval history, as well as one of the finest naval commanders who fought for either side during the Civil War.  When Admiral Farragut died in 1870 the Board of Trustees of The Woodlawn Cemetery provided a prominent circular lot at the entrance to the cemetery for his memorial.  Created by the firm of Casoni and Isola, the marble monument depicts the broken mast of a ship draped with the flag of the United States decorated with the emblems of Farragut&rsquo;s life and career.</td>
